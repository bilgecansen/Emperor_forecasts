# Emperor_forecasts
Forecasts of emperor penguins using space-for-time substitution.

**fit_sac_models.R** Fits the realtionship between sea ice concentration and average colony size with a species-area curve (sac) function form in the log scale.

**wrangle_data_forecast.R** Shapes the climate projection data into sutaible format for population projections with necessary transformations and bias corrections.

**forecast_N.R** Using the model fit above project emperor penguin colony abundances.
